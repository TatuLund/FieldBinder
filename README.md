# FieldBinder Add-on for Vaadin 8

FieldBinder is a little sibling of Binder for special case of single
field bindings. FieldBinder enables to use same Converters, Validators and
similar API to Binder with single field binding.

FieldBinder connects one Field component with value with one direction binding. 

A binder is a <i>binding</i>, representing the mapping of a single field,
through converters and validators, and acts as a buffer for bound value. 

A binder instance can be bound to a single value and field instance at a time,
but can be rebound as needed.

This add-on does not have client side implementation, widgetset compilation
is not needed.

- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- JRebel Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

### Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects

Note that Eclipse may give "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" errors for pom.xml. Use "Permanently mark goal resources in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build" quick-fix to mark these errors as permanently ignored in your project. Do not worry, the project still works fine. 

### Debugging server-side

If you have not already compiled the widgetset, do it now by running vaadin:install Maven target for fieldbinder-root project.

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your fieldbinder-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the fieldbinder-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/fieldbinder-demo/ to see the application.
